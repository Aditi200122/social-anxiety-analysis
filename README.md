# ðŸ§  Social Anxiety Data Analysis

This project explores how different lifestyle, biological, and demographic factors relate to anxiety levels in individuals. Using a dataset of 11,000 people, we examine patterns in sleep, stress, caffeine intake, gender, occupation, and more. All in relation to self-reported anxiety levels (on a 1â€“10 scale).

The goal is to uncover meaningful insights and test hypotheses using real data, visualizations, and statistical tests.

## What We Did

We started by exploring and cleaning the data, then asked some research questions like:

- Does sleep affect anxiety?
- Do men and women experience anxiety differently?
- Is stress level a strong predictor of anxiety?
- Does caffeine intake increase anxiety?
- Do certain jobs report more anxiety than others?

To answer these, we used:
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Boxplots and bar plots for group comparisons
- Pearson correlation tests for numeric relationships
- T-tests for two-group comparisons (e.g., gender)
- ANOVA + Tukey post-hoc tests** for multi-group differences (e.g., occupation)


 Key Findings

- More sleep = lower anxiety
- Higher stress = significantly higher anxiety
- Caffeine intake has a moderate positive link with anxiety
- Gender did not affect anxiety levels
- Doctors, engineers, and lawyers showed higher anxiety compared to others
